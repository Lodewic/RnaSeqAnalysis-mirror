# About this page

This page contains differential gene expression analyses on rat tissues for the Shire 2018 project. The included tissues are,

  * Brain
  * Lungs
  * Eyes
  
All analysis output is grouped together in .HTML reports for presentation.
All the resulting data can also be found in the **OutputData** subfolder of this report.

Use the navigation bar at the top to view the results for different tissues.

# Plots of results

You can explore individual genes from the differential analysis results in an interactive plot. These plots can be found in multiple ways.
